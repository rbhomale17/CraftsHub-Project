## ***Front End***

We have used json server API for the functionality of the login page. 
In the Navbar section, you can click on the login button which will open a Sign-up Page if you are a new user on our website so you have sign-up first. After creating a new account you will automatically be redirected to the login page within 1 second. Where you can use UserName as your registered Email id: - ***user@gmail.com*** and the password that was given at the time of sign-up as - ***user*** to login into the page, after successfully Logging in you will be redirected to the Index Page or a Home Page automatically. If you enter any wrong information on the Login page it will not show you Wrong Email or Password...
Where you can see the different tabs present on a navigation bar like product tabs, carts, and wishlists.

Then clicking on any tab present on the navbar will redirect that category products page where you can different products are shown. We have shown filtering functionality on the left side where you can filter based on price. At a time you can filter the products based on one selected filtering option. You can Sort the product based on the Price from low to high and Price from high to low. Then on every product, two buttons are there that you can use to add the product to the cart & wishlist respectively.
After adding the product to the Cart user can proceed to checkout by clicking on the **Checkout** button after filling details of the order and the delivery order will be placed if the cart is not empty.

## ***Back End***

For the back end, we have created the ***Admin Site*** in the navigation bar there is an option present called sign-up/Log-in after clicking on that option admin will be redirected to the login page ( for Admin Only ).
When a person tries to log in to the admin site to log in he/she must have to enter the correct Username & Password for login, After successful log in admin user will be redirected to the admin dashboard.
